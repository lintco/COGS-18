        "> Q: How do you know when to use a script or a module?  \n",
        "> A: If you are writing the code, you consider the task. Do you want to store code to import elsewhere? Module. Or do you want to write some code that you want to run from top to bottom? Script!\n",
        "\n",
        "> Q: How heavily will we be tested on our knowledge of a script and module? What type of questions can we expect?  \n",
        "> A: For E2, just know the similarities and difference. For the final, we'll be creating them...but we'll have mroe practice before then.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Q: I was wondering what the difference is going to be between E2 and the final? Is it just going to be similar to the first two midterms and cover more information or will it be more challenging, us attempting to create code like we do in assignments, etc.  \n",
        "> A: E2 focuses on material from loops-clases. Final exam focuses on material after classes, culminating in a mini-project. We'll discuss details soon in class!\n",

        "> Q: I'm still a little unsure about when to use self and how it works inside methods.   \n",

        "\n",
        "> Q: Also, how do I know when to use a class vs. just writing functions?  \n",
        "> A: Well, typically, I'll tell you. But, when you have to decide on your own...if you want to keep attributes and methods organized together and use attributes across different methods, class. If not, just a function.\n",

        "> A: Two things to check 1) restart your kernel in your notebook and try again; 2) if error persists, ensure that remote.py is in the same directory/folder as the notebook you're importing from\n",
        "\n",
        "> Q: Can we go over F strings again?  \n",
        "> A: Yup an f string allows you to include a variable within a string using {}. So if you had `var_6 = 6`.....you could include that value in an f string as follows: `f\"I like the number {var_6}.\"` Note that you do not have to convert the int to a string...and spacing is indicated within the string directly.\n",

        "> Q: How do you know whether to include a '()' after a class definition (i.e. class Exam2() or class Exam2)?  \n",
        "> A: When creating a class, the parentheses are optional. When creating an instance of a class, you always need parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Q: how ethical do you think chatgpt is   \n",
        "> A: Love this question. I think ChatGPT (and other LLMs) have serious ethical (and climate) concerns. Specifically, ChatGPT has been built, in many cases...although it's not entirely clear the extent to which this is true, on copyright material. So the model has learned from material that wasn't its to learn from. Beyond that, humans have made decisions as to how ChatGPT is to respond. Same for other LLMs (you'll notice that Claude is more empathetic, but also more resistant to making decisions for prompters). This is not without its ethical implications. Further, the carbon footprint for training these models is quite large. So, as a society, we have to do a cost-benefit analysis...and also regulate in meaningful ways, neither of which we've done well yet. Those are just the thoughts of the top of my head! Happy to discuss this further!\n",
        "\n",
        "> Q: How to read a question and understand what it wants me to execute   \n",
        "> A: Look back to the methods notes and the e2 review when I discussed the responses as we discussed this in a bit more detail! But, briefly here, you want to break the question down into smaller steps. To do this, you have to 1) figure out what the question is asking and then 2) figure out how you could use code to do this. Often students struggle to bridge those two steps. In that case, I encourage students to take a step back and figure out how *their* brains would do the task....did you need to look at each value over a list of numbers and add them up....if yes, then you need a loop! Did you have to use conditional logic? If yes, then you need an `if`\n",
        "\n",
        "> Q: i know when to USE self, but when it comes to the def method (self) im confused on why we JUST use self  \n",
        "> A: If you're only using self, that indicates you don't want/need any additional inputs from the user. Within a class, this typically means you're going to only operate on existing attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Q: If you were not to use the += or -= what would you code instead?  \n",
        "> A: If the code were `my_variable += 6`, this is shorthand for `my_variable = my_variable + 6`\n",
        "\n",
        "> Q: Will we have to be able to use read_* for any of our exams or assignments?  \n",
        "> A: Yes, for A5 and the final"
